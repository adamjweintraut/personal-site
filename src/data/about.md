Hi, I'm Adam. I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Target](https://target.com), where I am working on solving large-scale ML problems in pricing and forecasting. I am also a graduate student in the [Berkeley Masters of Information & Data Science](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/curriculum/) program. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer after graduating from [UW-Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/) with B.S. degrees in Computer Engineering + Computer Science.
